          The night sky has always been a source of wonder. Stars, planets, constellations â€” each has a story.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="text-yellow-400 font-semibold">Celestial Alignments</span> happen when planets or celestial bodies appear to align in the sky from our Earthly perspective.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ancient civilizations used star alignments for calendars, navigation, and even to guide their mythologies.
